This is a readme file on the printf repo. This repo is created to do a peer programming on the alx SE printf project. The projects we will work on will be described above later.

first what is printf

The printf() function sends a formatted string to the standard output (the display). This string can display formatted variables and special control characters
so in order to fulfill the project given we create some prototypes header file called main.h . functions Variadic and so on

we will add comments in the code we develop for further understanding
this project has about 16 tasks on printf.
